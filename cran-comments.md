itertools2 is a port of Python's excellent itertools module and is a replacement
for the itertools package on CRAN. While the latter package provides some
functionality, it is incomplete and is rarely updated.

We would like to see iterators used more often within the R community, similar
to other platforms, such Python. With itertools2, our goal is to enable R users
to utilize iterators by providing a wealth of iterator solutions and recipes.
